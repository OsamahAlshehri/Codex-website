            ICD-10-AM Overview 
        </h6>

       <p>
        &emsp; In a word, relying on technology for everything, it is particularly important to use the technology to serve the human health in the best way. The use of technology in the healthcare sector has been growing extremely fast in the last two decades. Healthcare coding is one of the technologies used in healthcare sectors and ICD-10-AM is one of the best examples of healthcare coding. An overview of the ICD-10-AM will be the main topic of this article. Including definitions, history, advantages, Beneficiaries, and the importance of ICD-10-AM.
       </p>


       <p>
        &emsp; ICD-10-AM refers to International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Australian Modification. This classification is made to give each medical disease, injury, and related health problems a specific code that contains numerical and alphabetical characters.  In a basic way, it does translate the patient's health condition from words into an alpha numeric code. 
       </p>

       <p>
        &emsp; The healthcare coding system has gone through many updates, which we will mention the most well-known of them:</p> 
        <p><strong>ICD:</strong>Was first made in 1893 by a Parisian statistician named Jacques Bertillon.</p>
        <p><strong>ICD-10:</strong>This is the tenth version of the ICD. It was released by the World Health Organization in 1992.</p>
        <p><strong>ICD-10-AM:</strong>This is the modified version of the ICD by the Australian government which was published in 1998.</p>

       <p>
        &emsp; The ICD-10-AM has many advantages such as improving the data quality by allowing more precise data collection and reporting. It also improved the accuracy of the classification of health care conditions, which makes the patient care much better. The healthcare providers are using the ICD-10-AM to allocate resources easily and efficiently. And there are many beneficiaries from the ICD-10-AM including healthcare providers, Researchers, Patients, and insurance companies.
       </p>


       <p>
        &emsp; The importance of using the healthcare coding systems such as ICD-10-A can be summarized in the following way: </p>
        <p><strong>Public health issues reporting and tracking:</strong> It is essential to use the healthcare coding systems to track public health diseases.</p>
        <p><strong>International standards and communication:</strong> Health data is much eaiser to be compared and shared between countries using a standardized coding system.</p>
        <p><strong>Healthcare Managment:</strong>  The accurate statistical results from the ICD-10-AM gives the healthcare management a bitter decision making. 
        <p><strong>Economy:</strong>  The coding of health care conditions allows an accurate understanding of these conditions by the insurance companies and for easier insurance claims.</p>
       

       <p>
        &emsp; The different between ICD-10 and UCD-10-AM could be summarized in the advantage of the ICD-10-AM having more detailed information of a specific diseases or health condition that fits the Australian health care systems. This made the ICD-10-AM to be more efficient and beneficial. Although, other countries such as New Zealand and Saudi Arabia are using the ICD-10-AM. 
       </p>


       <p>
        &emsp; In conclusion, we can see how important it is to use this system in the healthcare fields to improve the accuracy, and the ease of data. And it shows the importance of having a compatible coding system with the countryâ€™s health care system is crucial for seamless integration, better healthcare planning, and enhanced patient outcomes.
