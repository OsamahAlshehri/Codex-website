        HL7 Overview 
       </h6>

       <p>
        &emsp; With the increase and abundance of technology in our contemporary world, we must benefit from this technology in the service of humanity in the health field. Development in the health field improves the quality of life for individuals and improves the services provided in this field to raise efficiency and reduce the risks of diseases and errors. In 1987, HL7 International was established as a non-profit organization by HIS and LIS in the United States. 
       </p>

       <p>
        &emsp; HL7 stands for Health Level 7. And can be defined as the standards, rules, guidelines, protocol for exchanging digital health information. To understand it accurately, we must know that HL7 itself is not a digital application or website that healthcare facilities access and use. Rather, HL7 provides standards for a mechanism for sharing, exchanging, interacting, and retrieving digital medical data. 
       </p>

       <p>
        &emsp; HL7 is used in over 50 countries and has over 500 members from different healthcare fields around the world such as hospitals, pharmacies, healthcare supply companies and laboratories. And by having the same health data standards, all these members can easily exchange, share, and retrieve these health data among their different systems.
       </p>

       <p>
        &emsp; If we imagen two different people speaking two different languages and they need to communicate with each other, they need to have a common language between them so they can communicate effectively. In our simple example, the HL7 represents the common language and the two people represent the different systems used in healthcare.  HL7 also allows the use of a variety of different systems such as PACK, ORU, lab information system, medical record system, and more. HL7 rule is to integrate these different and independent systems to communicate with each other. 
       </p>

       <p>
        &emsp; HL7 messaging standards are divided into two mostly known versions, Version 2(V2) and Version3 (V3). While (V2) is the most used globally and (V3) represents a small portion of real-word usage. There are more than 80 diverse types of HL7 messages. and they have their own purpose and structure, but we will not talk about the types in this article. The organization provides their standards free and can be downloaded through their official website (Hl7.org). They also on how to use these standards to create and understand health data formatting. 
       </p>

       <p>
        &emsp; In conclusion, HL7 improves patient safety and care quality by offering a universal language. As we move forward, HL7 will play an even more key role in the quest for effective and error-free healthcare services. Let's adopt these guidelines and make sure that cutting-edge technology has positive effects on all facets of the health industry, providing superior care for human health.
